          Differential privacy is a mathematical framework for providing privacy guarantees. 
          It ensures that the removal or addition of a single database item does not substantially 
          affect the outcome of any analysis.

        <h2>Key Concepts</h2>
        <p>
          The fundamental principle behind differential privacy is that when looking at the output 
          of a differentially private analysis, it should be difficult to determine whether any 
          specific individual's data was included in the original dataset or not.
