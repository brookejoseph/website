          For the people who know me best I feel like they'd most likely describe using these words, <strong>hard working, disciplined, competitive</strong>. I think having a combination of these traits is both a blessing and a curse.
        </p>
        
        <p>
          A mixture of competitiveness and strong work ethic, for almost my entire life has manifested as seeing others work hard and feeling a strong desire to <strong>outwork them</strong>. That feeling has been innate, impossible to describe. This has played out in school and life and I think is a big contributor to where I'm at now in life. Although I think a lot of the holes have exposed themselves as I try to scale that way of being and build something bigger and bigger.
        </p>

          The first time I really started to see this was when I entered university and most people worked hard and were competitive. I struggled to see what set me apart of the rest, because my whole life, before this point, I've put myself in rooms of people smarter than me but there was always a clear path to, what I considered, becoming smarter than them, I just had to <strong>outwork them</strong> and I was always the hardest working person in any room, so the directions were clear, execute. University was different.
        </p>
        
        <p>
          So I started to reevaluate in the back of my mind, I thought the solution was to scale what I had already been doing, <strong>work even harder!</strong> For my first two semesters, I essentially had no fun lol, I worked 24/7 thinking adding more work, building more projects, connecting with more people was the solution to being "better". As most know energy drinks became my best friend lol.
        </p>
        
        <p>
          After my first coop I both realized a lot about myself and received a lot of helpful feedback. I found that my biggest strength is <strong>executing on tasks</strong>. If I have even a vague idea of I want done I'll get it done faster than most, I'd be willing to lose sleep over it. I know I can deliver and deliver fast. But the part I missed out on was the <strong>planning</strong>, not rushing into things, thinking things through. I actually thought this was something I needed to revert and fix and work slower (which I now think is a silly solution).
        </p>
        
        <p>
          Instead I received good feedback from one of my bosses, he told me that <strong>"sometimes you can't change things about yourself, you just need to figure out how to work around them."</strong> So I took this and started to spend time thinking, planning and then executing on those visions. It seems to be working well for me now, but I also am open and experimenting with different strategies as I continue to work in fast paced environments with smart people.

          I was inspired to write this because recently I got bit with the competition bug again and felt a strong desire to outwork everyone. I felt the rushing feeling again of just wanting to jump into any project that sounded exciting. This time, though, I sort of stepped back and realized that <strong>work ethic isn't a competition</strong>, it's about <strong>understanding what's worth killing yourself over</strong> and going all in.

          When you look at other people and hear them working hard and you have a feel like you need to lock in and work hard, then you know you haven't found something worth obsessing over. This shouldn't be an excuse to not work hard, but rather allow yourself time to think away from work and make sense of what you're doing. The strong need you feel to stick your nose into any project that comes your way without any strong desire or reason pulling you in that direction usually comes from a <strong>scarcity mindset</strong>.
